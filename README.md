# Pacmen-Exercise

This repository is intended to include  the exercises I had to resolve during the 7th week of the MIT JavaScript course. The Pacmen Exercises creates a Pacman on demand (button click) and moves these Pacmen across the page.

## Title of the project: 

Pacmen Animation Project of Tomás Meyer

## Brief project description:

The Pacmen Exercises creates a Pacman on demand (button click) and moves these Pacmen across the page. The repository structure is divided into
HTML, JS and image folder, which include:

- index.html. The file that organizes my JavaScript and HTML codes into one file.
- pacmen.js. The file where I define the functions to create a Pacman and move the Pacmen across the screen.
- images folder, where we hold the Pacman pictures.

## How to run:

1. First of all, you need to go to the repository at the following direction: https://github.com/tfmeyermunoz/Pacmen-Exercise.
2. Download all the files included in the repository.
4. Open the eyes.html file in your favourite browser and move the mouse to see the eyes movement animation.
5. In case you want to change the styling of the animation, modify the eyes.css file.

## Next steps:

It would be wonderful to try to make the Pacmen Exercise look more similar to the real game. For example, I would like to add the following:

1. A labyrinth to move the Pacmen only across the paths that were crated.
2. A css file to add some styling to the background and improve the user interface appearence.
3. Add other figures and be able to make the Pacmen "eat" those other figures.
